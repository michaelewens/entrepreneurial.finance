## Description

This week-long workshop follows the structure of the Entrepreneurial Finance PhD course described on this website with several modifications. The inaugural workshop was held in August 2024 at Imperial College ([past program here](/summer-phd-workshop-2024/)) and the second was held in 2025 ([past program here](/summer-phd-workshop-2025/)). The program covers major topics from the 6-week in-person course and highlights key institutional details required for successful entrepreneurial finance research. Several sessions focus on research methodology, key databases, opportunities to present ideas, and live data analysis examples. This workshop is **not** a substitute for the NBER Entrepreneurship Bootcamp. See the [2025 program](/summer-phd-workshop-2025/) for a preview of the format and content.

**Lectures led by:**
- Michael Ewens (Columbia)
- Gilles Chemla (Imperial College, CNRS, and CEPR)
- Rui Silva (Nova)
- Francisco Queiro (Nova)

## Goals and Teaching Objectives

The workshop provides an overview of modern research in entrepreneurial finance and the foundation for success in producing research: mastering institutional details including definitions, industry norms, regulations, laws, databases, and disclosure rules.

## Target Students

Students past their second year of PhD programs in economics, finance, strategy, management, or related fields. Preference given to applicants from outside top schools with faculty active in entrepreneurial finance and those outside the U.S.
