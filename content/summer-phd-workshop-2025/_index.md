## Summer PhD Workshop on Entrepreneurial Finance

**Dates**: Monday, June 2nd to Friday, June 6th. [Closed] Applications are due January 15th, 2025.

**Location**: Paris Dauphine University

**Co-organizers**: [Michael Ewens](https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/people/michael-ewens) (Columbia Business School and NBER) and [Gilles Chemla](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/g.chemla) (Imperial College, CNRS, and CEPR).

### Description

This week-long workshop roughly follows the structure of the Entrepreneurial Finance Ph.D. course [described on this site](/syllabus/) with several modifications. The inaugural workshop was held in August 2024 at Imperial College ([past program here](/summer-phd-workshop-2024/)). We will cover the major topics from the 6-week in-person course and highlight key institutional details required for successful entrepreneurial finance research. Several sessions will focus on the "how" of research, key databases used in the field, opportunities to present new ideas, and live examples of some data analysis in recent work. Students will have ample opportunities to interact with their peers and the participating faculty. Importantly, this workshop is ***not*** a substitute for the invaluable NBER Entrepreneurship Bootcamp, which provides a rigorous education in the broad entrepreneurship area in a fantastic environment (the NBER Summer Institute). This workshop provides in-depth coverage of entrepreneurial finance topics in some bootcamp sessions.

Lectures will be lead by Michael Ewens (Columbia), Gilles Chemla (Imperial College, CNRS, and CEPR), and Jessica Jeffers (HEC).

### Goals and teaching objectives

Few universities have courses dedicated to entrepreneurial finance, while the opportunities for research and job opportunities are growing. Motivated by this, the workshop aims to provide an overview of modern research in entrepreneurial finance and provide the foundation for success in producing research: mastering institutional details. These include definitions, industry norms, regulations (history of changes), laws, databases, disclosure rules, and more. There is a hidden "literature" of these institutional details in all major empirical work. This course presents a literature review for these details while teaching entrepreneurial finance.

### Target students

Students past their second year of the Ph.D. program in economics, finance, strategy, management, or related fields are welcome to apply. Applicants from outside top schools with faculty active in the entrepreneurial finance area and those outside the U.S. will be given preference.

### Schedule

Each day includes approximately 6 hours of class sessions (lectures, student presentations, etc), lunch (sometimes group, otherwise independent), and two group dinners (Tuesday and Friday).

Mike Ewens will lead most of the sessions, with Gilles Chemla and faculty local to Paris leading the remaining sessions.
