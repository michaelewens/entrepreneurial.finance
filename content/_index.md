Welcome to the online home of "Research in Entrepreneurial Finance", a Ph.D. course taught by [Michael Ewens](https://michaelewens.com/) at Columbia Business School.

## Course objectives

The course aims to provide an **overview of modern research in entrepreneurial finance** and, more importantly, provide the foundation for success in producing research: **mastering institutional details**. These include definitions, industry norms, regulations (history of changes), laws, databases, disclosure rules, and more.

There is a hidden "literature" of these institutional details in all major empirical work. This course presents a literature review of sorts for these details while teaching entrepreneurial finance along the way.

## How does the course work?

Each of the course's six modules are each split into two parts:

### Overview of the research topic

Review the literature on the module's topic, main research questions, and basic conclusions.

### Institutional details through papers

We use 2-3 selected papers to explore the institutional details central to the paper's main results.
